## Overview

This repository contains a production-style data pipeline for processing and standardizing the central US and international medical codes.

The pipeline simulates the real-world data engineering tasks, such as those performed at companies like Epic, Oracle-Cerner, and health insurance providers.

The goal is to transform the raw code files into clean, validated, and standardized CSVs for use in clinical systems, analytics, and research.
